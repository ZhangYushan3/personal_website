I’m a PhD student at the Computer Vision Laboratory at Linköping University, advised by Michael Felsberg. Previously, I was an intern in at NVIDIA’s Dynamic Vision and Learning Group. I'm  interested in computer vision adn machine learning in general. My work focuses on 3D computer vision, e.g., scene flow estimation, LiDAR video segmentation and tracking.
